🧠 Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The objective is to implement the KNN algorithm using the Iris dataset and evaluate its performance with different K values, normalization, and confusion matrix analysis.


🎯 Objective

- Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
- Normalize the dataset for better distance calculations
- Test accuracy for different values of `K`
Evaluate with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualize the confusion matrix
