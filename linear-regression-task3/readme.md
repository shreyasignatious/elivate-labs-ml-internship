🧠 Task : Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The goal is to implement **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using a real-world housing dataset and evaluate model performance.

---

 🎯 Objective

- Predict house prices using linear regression.
- Learn how to clean data and fit regression models.
- Evaluate using MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
- Visualize the model and interpret feature importance (coefficients).



 ▶️ How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to run this project on your local system using **VS Code and Command Prompt**:

 1. 🖥️ Open Project in VS Code

- Open VS Code
- Click `File → Open Folder` → select the folder `linear-regression-task3`

### 2. 📂 Project Structure

linear-regression-task3/
├── code.py ← Main Python script with all logic
├── Housing.csv ← Dataset used for regression
└── README.md ← This documentation file

3.💻 Open Terminal in VS Code

- Press `Ctrl + ` ` (backtick key) or
- Go to `Terminal → New Terminal`
- This opens a terminal at the bottom of VS Code

Alternatively, open **Command Prompt**:
```bash
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\linear-regression-task3

4.. 📦 Install Required Libraries

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

5. ▶️ Run the Python Script

In terminal (inside the project folder), run:
python code.py

You’ll see output in the terminal with evaluation metrics and a plot if applicable.



📊 Libraries Used
pandas – for handling data
