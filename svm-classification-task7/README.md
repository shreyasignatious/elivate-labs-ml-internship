 🧠 Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Breast Cancer Classification

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The objective is to classify tumors as benign or malignant using Support Vector Machines with both linear and RBF kernels. The dataset used is the popular Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

 🎯 Objective

- Implement SVM for binary classification
- Train models using Linear and RBF kernels
- Tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`) using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Use cross-validation to validate model performance
